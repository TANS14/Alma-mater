                <p style="text-align: center;background-color: green;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;">History and development of Pines City National High School:</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;background-color: maroon;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 15px;">The Pines City National High School started as an annex of Baguio City National High School with only two classes in the first year with three<br>
            teachers, it is squaring on the ground of Baguio Central School. The school started with meagre and inadequate facilities and with finding on the<br>
            graces of the Mother School. Textbooks, equipment and other facilities had been found out to be utterly inadequate and the students and<br>
            teachers have to take proper steps and exercises initiative in order to help alleviate the problem. As the years passed, problems became greater<br>
            due to the increase in enrolment. Teachers also increased but not in direct proportion to the increase in the enrolment.<br><br>
            On November 19, 1973, the school became an independent school with its own separate character, the problem became crucial, more evident<br>
            and more problematic. Considering the fact that there is no school building of its own and no school site for that matter, In 1976, there was a<br>
            very good opening with the presence of a National air in amount of two hundred ten thousand (210,000) for the construction of the Bagong<br>
            Lipunan school building. In 1978, another Bagong Lipunan building was constructed, consisting of a classroom. This has minimally eased up<br>
            the problems of lack of classrooms but school population continued to increase by leaps and bounds that the fifteen classrooms were not enough<br>
            to accommodate 1500 students even if the main campus, an annex was created through the resolution of the city council sponsored by<br>
            Counselor Jane Bugnosen in 1983. Bonifacio and Quirino are the first two annexes under Pines City National High School.<br><br>
            On July 1987, Pines City National High School was nationalized by virtue of executive order 189 pleasing all secondary school teacher render<br>
            the administrative super vision and control of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports for other purposes.<br>
            In 1989, PCNHS was nationalized thus the name is changed to Pines City National High School. As regards its administration personnel and<br>
            staff, the first principal was the alte Leandro Flora, followed by Concepcion Valencia and then Philip Flores, Elma Donaal, then the first<br>
            assistant principal Rosalita Guadana, followed by Flocerfida L. Mina which became co-terminus with the salary standardization Law, then<br>
            Rachel M. Bugtong as principal for decades and then to be Leticia I. Sab-it to the present. â€‹<br><br>
            In 1990, PCNHS started a special class and were given incentive allowance by the city government of Baguio City. In 1992, PCNHS is chosen<br>
            as a pilot school for the proposed special science curriculum and one of the Special Science Schools in the entire Philippines.<br><br>
            Hence another special class been started in 2009, the special class in Journalism. The Special Program in Journalism at the Secondary Level was<br>
            implemented nationwide on June 2009. This is in line with the Campus Journalism(CJ) Act of 1991 Republic Act no. 7079 which provides for<br>
            the development and promotion of Campus Journalism and other related purposes.<br><br>
            Now, there are eight buildings including the newly constructed three-storey to accommodate the fast growing population of Pines City National<br>
            High School.
